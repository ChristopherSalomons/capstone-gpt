mentalhealth,01/04/2019,anxious-wreck,b7uts4,4,1,"Supposed to gain weight, I really donâ€™t want to do it. I donâ€™t want to share numbers in here but all Iâ€™m going to say is that I lost weight in the second half of 2018 and have continued to lose a bit of weight since January. I started going to a gym now and I was asked if I had trouble with eating and that I am underweight for my height (Iâ€™m a guy, 177 cm or around 5ft 10?). Iâ€™m on a journey to regain muscle mass because I realized that what I thought was fat in my body was actually loose skin (I used to be just overweight and I donâ€™t know, my body just isnâ€™t tight at all, lol) and also just a big hipbone (which isnâ€™t that big but my mind makes it seem enormous), and that my body fat percentage is actually very low.

3 years ago, this wouldâ€™ve been the dream scenario for me. â€œI need to gain weight? I get to eat as much as I want!â€ But today itâ€™s a really scary thought because I associate weight gain with being miserable again like I was throughout all my life when I got bullied at school and later when I was very depressed in 2017 and the first half of 2018. Iâ€™m well aware of this fear being irrational and Iâ€™m working on it with my therapy but itâ€™s so hard to not think about calories and fat and weight and the scale, that goddamn scale.

I needed to vent. Iâ€™m scared and I know my weight hasnâ€™t gone up and that it actually got lower because I think Iâ€™m eating enough, or at least enough to not freak out but apparently itâ€™s not enough to get to my goal. I need to gain muscle mass and a bit of body fat, I really do know that but Iâ€™m scared.

I have a problem: I can't force myself to do anything useful for my future, even to do things I have to do as a university student. I just waste my time on any kind of entertainment: games, social media, shows, friends etc, basically, everything that I can get pleasure from without actually trying hard. I can't seem to be scared of being expelled because I don't do my job as a student properly, like ""everything will be fine either way"". I'm anxious because I'm aware that it is not the right way of thinking. Sometimes my anxiety takes over and i get a huge boost of motivation and become productive for a few days but it ends up even worse with me wasting a lot more time laying in bed afterwards, like I'm trying to compensate for these days, I feel like highly addictied to dopamine and I can't do much about it. Sometimes I'd prefer hanging out with friends instead of going to an important exam. Thinking about it now makes me sick, but I'm sure that I would find an excuse for me to do it next time. I study IT and i genuinely enjoy doing programming, until i get hands on those entertainment things. The same goes for my hobbies, I like music, art, design, and were so happy doing it on my rare highly motivated moods to the fullest, wish it would never end, just imagining being highly motivated .

mentalhealth,01/04/2019,stitchitch,b7v2vi,3,3,"Rant...trigger for baby-related trauma (a video, not mine) and death(not mine) I know i got myself into commenting when i didn't have to. Probably shouldnt have. But on YouTube, there was a video about a girl who stabbed her baby when she was 15. She did something absolutely terrible. Unforgiveable. She deserves her prison statement. But i couldn't help but feel sympathic by the way she related the story. She may have been lying to get sympathy, that's true, but her story is plausible.

Everyone was calling her a monster. Psycho. Evil. A faker for her guilt.  And the thing was, hearing her story and keeping her age in mind, I dont think she's a horrible person, just a scared, traumatized girl at the time, who didn't know what to do. And people were talking about how it didn't make sense what she was saying about her reasons at the time, and i just think to myself that the commenters don't understand trauma and how trauma works. How irrational you can become in panic and shock, fear, guilt, shame, emotional torture. There's been times when I've nearly killed myself for all of those emotions raging all at once.

I couldn't help but comment when someone said it didn't make sense to end pain by inflicting pain. As a self-harmer and a previously suicidal person, i couldn't let that slide. 

Anyway, a rant. And if anyone could understand the messed up rationale that is mental health disorders and trauma, i thought it would be here.

And please, if you disagree, please be polite about it. I just needed a rant because its not worth going into a commenting war on the video and i needed a release.

mentalhealth,01/04/2019,boopy-cupid,b7vgdp,5,1,"Diagnosis help Hi everyone

First time poster here and sorry if I've got the wrong sub, I'm also new to Reddit :) 

I'm hoping to get some insight into reaching a diagnosis. Is there anyone here who might be able to look at my case history and give me an idea of what I should be pursuing? I've been seeing psychiatrists for awhile now and I'm not really any closer to diagnosis. I've been told I exhibit traits of a few disorders but nothing concrete (BPD, OCD, PMDD, ADHD - among others). I'll write a general history but I'm a very open person so I'm happy to answer any questions.

Maternal family history (paternal history unknown): 
      - mother diagnosed with OCD, GAD, (previously) somatoform disorder, bipolar 1 and possible autism spectrum and/or ADHD (diagnosis received late in life and no neurological testing has been pursued)
       - Brother diagnosed GAD and MDD
       - Multiple family members diagnosed with bipolar disorder, 2 schizophrenia 
       - Addictions common throughout the generations 
       - long history of intergenerational trauma

My history
       - cannabis user for 3 years currently 24yrs of age
       - long history of trauma starting in childhood, PTSD misdiagnosed as adjustment disorder at 15 after another major trauma (re-occurring PTSD symptoms since, mainly controlled)
        - history of major depressive episodes starting from 11
        - history of self harm and suicidal ideation from 11 &gt;
        - no history of mania
        - poor executive functions (difficulty with task execution and completion, difficulties with micro processes, poor time management skills, poor organisation skills, slow decision making processes)
        - sensory issues (issues with fabrics, textures, lights and sounds. I find simple tasks like doing the dishes or shopping very difficult)
        - Intrusive thinking and cyclical ruminating from a young age (including violent intrusive thoughts (self not others) ) 
        - issues with anxiety and panic attacks
        - history of Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified 


Medication history
A variety of antidepressants, I respond best to SSRI's and SNRI's however I have severe withdrawals from SNRI's. 
Methylphenidate (ritalin), responds well to low dosages. High dosages cause anxiety issues. No euphoria or mania
Atypical antipsychotic olanzapine, responds well with a reduction in rumination, anxiety and better sleep out comes

I've done therapy for years (CBT, ACT, DBT, Narrative) and seen a few psychiatrists and no one can seems to decide what's wrong with me or what testing to try... so any insight would be much appreciated! And any suggestions of testing I should pursue. I've had difficulty accessing neuropsychiatric testing due to my cannabis usage but the executive function issues have been there since I was a child.

Thank you!

mentalhealth,01/04/2019,chunkysundae,b7vnay,2,3,"USA: Working through untreated mental illness...resource recommendations? Hey Reddit,
 
Currently in between a fairly significant rock and a hard place and could use any recommendations you might have...

High-level overview (TW: suicide)

Historical:
In my mid-twenties (2013) I finally reached out for help when I realized I had great benefits with an employer. My parents committed suicide (in 2006) and taking on the grave responsibility that came with having younger siblings to rear while I was a legal adult at 19 was a lot. Depression made it difficult to leave the bed or eat. Full-disclosure: parents didnâ€™t do things â€œright,â€ â€” no resources were left behind after their deaths except a lot of pain. To make it work financially, I juggled FT Starbucks, a PT flower shop, and PT stocking shelves at Wal-Mart overnight for a few years, and then a corporate place gave me a chance as a leg-up. I didnâ€™t do great in the new mom role to teenagers, but all of my siblings are alive and have high school diplomas to date. I digress.

From 2013-2017 I worked with psychologists and psychotherapists, and they put me through a barrage of medicinal cocktails. My doctor at the time had a difficult time discerning if I was living with Bipolar II or major depression+anxiety+PTSD because of how cyclical things were/but somehow managed stability unmedicated. Regardless, very small doses of two medications and bi-weekly therapy for years worked to level me out, and I miraculously ended up in a steady dream job, working hard, labeled as a leader in the community, etc. 

...Because I was doing stellar things, I was poached by a different company, and left my employer. All normal, career advancement stuff. Which in theory was good...until I lost my medical coverage, and costs for my medicine skyrocketedâ€”this was in late 2017.

As soon as I couldnâ€™t afford my medicine and the Rx was out, it was like I hit the accelerator and drove off a cliff. With the new job, I didnâ€™t have time built up to take FMLA or even enough sick time to deal with my mental breakdown. Lost that job due to needing the time off. I drained my savings to move for another new job. 

All-in-all, no decisions I made allowed me to affordable my obtain my medicine. I ended up homeless.

Present:
2018 was terrible. I was literally at the mercy of others (my siblings arenâ€™t in any way shape or form able to help me and dealing with their own demons), and the only thing that kept me clawing at the lid of a coffin was a MacBook Pro and free WiFi. Someone threw me the bone of putting together a site for a non-profit (design/build/etc.) using my portfolio of work; word of mouth saw a few more jobs freelance jobs come along. An acquaintance was kind enough to let me live in their basement for three months to keep me out of the womenâ€™s shelters while I steamrolled more marketing for small businesses, and I finally was able to pull myself together enough to buy a second-hand blazer and land a full-time job. 

Hereâ€™s what I have:
A (sh-t) job and I live in a (sh-tty) apartment, but I have a check coming in this Friday and a pillow for my head. Some food for the week is in the fridge. My clothes are clean. Internet to send this post out. My trusty MacBook. Smart as a whip. Sobriety* (Iâ€™ve never touched anything illegal after watching what it did to my parents, and I donâ€™t drink). *Side note: addiction is really tough on the mentally ill/homeless communities, and is a substantial barrier to them getting off the streets. I am working on being grateful for what I have. 

Lacking:
Benefits and access to affordable healthcare and medicine. 
Iâ€™ve done the research and there are no sliding scale resources available to me in the area. My income is just above poverty guidelines which disqualifies me from programs that can help. I canâ€™t afford supplemental insurance. 

The problem:
I am sinking again â€” have legit been in bed for days and havenâ€™t left the apartment. I did manage to take a shower before writing this which is a start... the depression is starting to take over again and I simply donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m trying to hang on because employment with benefits may be just around the corner. I met with the director of a University last week who is considering me for a two-year appointment. 

Iâ€™m looking for:
-Access to a medical professional that can Rx for Seroquel (Quetiapine) and Vistaril (Hydroxizine). These two helped significantly and I was on them for 24-months successfully. 
-Affordable generic Rx ideas domestically. I can handle about $100 per month. 
-Iâ€™d also appreciate any info on psychotherapy. Online resources simply havenâ€™t worked. Iâ€™m having a difficult time adjusting to the â€œwhere I wasâ€ in the Golden Era to â€œwhere I am now,â€ sleeping on the floor of my studio apartment.

mentalhealth,01/04/2019,calrayers,b7x0fy,0,1,"21 M. Started smoking 2 years ago @ 19; 36 days clean: will I return to my old self? It all started going to my mates-friends house, I was so anti-drugs; I tried weed and was hooked since.

I 100% abused it, it was like the love of my life no matter how much I hated the taste of it; I adored the feeling. It went from a gram a week to taking days off to smoke up.

2 years has gone and Iâ€™ve gotten no-where in life, it was all about when I was next getting high. I had a carpet-fitting career then I stopped sleeping on certain-days and that really messed me up.

I still continued to smoke it until I started noticing changes, like Iâ€™m not my old-self. I lost spirituality in what I believe in, I lost my social-status. I lost money, I gained weight. I lost my brain in certain parts.

I believe all drugs effect you in different ways, but weed at first was like the best thing ever and it complimented my life, then I became â€œdependantâ€ (I think). Iâ€™m just glad I stopped 2 years in.

I noticed working on a building site Iâ€™d feel â€œsketchyâ€, like maybe I said the wrong thing to one of the guys, that they can see through me and who I am, Iâ€™d feel slightly on-edge speaking to someone and when it was a 3-way convo Iâ€™d become irrelevant and if I was talking I may lose track of conversation, Iâ€™d lose train of thought so quickly. Itâ€™s like I forgot how to connect with people.

I miss my old self, I want to have the same drive as before but I canâ€™t find it; I am not depressed, but I can relate. Iâ€™m just disappointed in myself.

Will my brain repair itself and go back to how it was? Around the same time as I started smoking I found a great burst of confidence and energy in my life I just felt so good, then weed took over my life, my friends, family and myself saw it coming. But like I said; I just want to go back to normal; over a month in Iâ€™m 100% feeling a difference BUT I know Iâ€™m not all there, just yet. I just need to know if Iâ€™ll find my bearings again. Because I miss it. I miss the old me.

mentalhealth,01/04/2019,bananaspliff420,b7x7y8,0,1,"Can uncertainty in OCD ever be a 50/50 scenario? How can you ""accept uncertainty"" in that case, or is there no hope? I've been reading a lot recently on techniques to cope with my OCD and I've found that many people recommend ""accepting uncertainty"" as a method to overcome OCD. However, according to the author of an article I just read, accepting uncertainty ""does not mean you make up in your mind its 50/50"", but that the probabilities sometimes are usually so low they are negligible and therefore he's more able to get over them, that the uncertainty is easier to accept with confidence. But what about when the matter at trial in obsessions and doubt is actually 50/50, or even more? How do you accept uncertainty in that case? Does it mean that because my doubts and obsessions are close to being 50 % or more that they're true? Does it mean that in that case there would be no excape?

I've also kind of been seriously obsessing with whether or not my recent obsessions are OCD or not, whether its a lifetime sentence and if I'll ever get over them, making it an obsession by itself and making the matters worse. Actually, I even think this article can be very misleading to people suffering from OCD where his ""it's not 50/50 so just get over it because the chances are close to null"" doesn't apply. Sometimes the odds are close, or at least it feels like they are. I feel the more articles I read on the internet the more confused I get about my obsessions, and the less hope I get from feeling better.

&amp;#x200B;

The quote I am referring to is the following:

&amp;#x200B;

""Accepting uncertainty does not mean accepting that there is a â€œ1 out of 2â€ shot that your fear could be true. Â What it means is you have abandoned the mandate to determine what the odds are in the first place. Â As I write this, I am accepting the possibility, however small, that my computer is emitting some kind of toxic substance that may be giving me some kind of health issue. Â I am further accepting that, merely by attending to writing this, I may be failing to attend to a more important matter, such as whether I may have committed some kind of crime earlier in the day. Â To say these things is not to say that I believe these concerns are as likely to be true as a flip of the coin. Â What I am saying is that the possibility simply exists at a level greater than absolute zero. Â This allows for the understanding that the possibility may be so low, that I can treat it with such disinterest such that I refuse to even analyze *how* low the possibility is. ""

mentalhealth,01/04/2019,123happily,b7xv5k,0,1,"Iâ€™m scared to label myself as misophonic, but feel I am. Please help me judge the severity of my symptoms since I know nobody with this disorder. Hi guys! Iâ€™m new here so if this doesnâ€™t quite fit the guidelines or themes Iâ€™m happy to move to another sub :).

I have self diagnosed myself with mild-medium misophonia. Misophonia is a disorder that links the threat assessment part of the brain to the auditory processing part, causing fight/flight reactions and/or feelings of fear, violence, rage, panic and similar when a trigger sound is heard.

Iâ€™ve heard from a misophonic person here on reddit that they often have to run from the room, plug their ears desperately in order to focus and keep some sanity, and have trouble focusing whenever a trigger sound is heard.

So these are my symptoms: When I was younger Iâ€™d block my ears to concentrate when I heard a â€˜bad soundâ€™ (what I used to call trigger sounds) and would flinch away from bad sounds  and generally ask (if possible) for it to be stopped. â€˜Bad soundsâ€™ for me are any patternless, sharp, â€˜popâ€™ or â€˜cracklesâ€™. Other sounds include particular voices (I am aware that this may pertain to a different cause, regardless, reactions are the same, or even worse). Human sounds aside from speaking (scratching on skin, mouth sounds, chewing, etc) are extreme triggers for me.

I have never run from a room, or shouted, usually dealt with the feeling of â€˜ew, argh, make it stopâ€™ myself. I have left a dinner table early (I had finished but the expectation was that everybody remained until the last person finished) to escape the sounds, but only got as far as about 1 metre away before the host asked me where I was going. Not wanting to make it any more awkward, I stayed.

I recently got noise cancelling headphones and it improved this significantly, however it is considered rude to wear them in conversations/in class/when eating, so I canâ€™t wear them often, and particularly in places where I feel they are most needed.

There are sometimes where I feel like Iâ€™m the happiest person in the world and others when I feel like all is hopeless and I might as well cut the cord. I might feel calm in relaxed one second but heated up and aggressive the next. And these happen with zero correlation to my surrounding environment.

There have often been times where I think of suicide and self harm for various reasons. The part that scares me is most of these reasons arenâ€™t based on negative events in my life, but most of the times just sheer curiosity, and this is a frequent thought.

mentalhealth,01/04/2019,1trueseven,b7xxc4,0,1,"Super duper frustrated; hypomanic? Hi, looking for your anecdotal input on whether this is/isn't hypomania and what you would do in my position.

Though I haven't had in one in at least a year, I think I might have just entered a hypomanic phase. During the day today I've been euphoric, but last night, and again tonight I've gotten super frustrated. There is an unmistakable feeling I get when I'm manic/hypomanic, and I feel it now --a nagging feeling that I MUST DO X, but not knowing what X is. It feels like a mental itch, which I cannot locate or identify, but has pushed me to the limits of my patience and drives me insane. It feels like pressure in my head and chest has built up to a boiling point, and I need to find some way to release it. I feel like I will have a heart attack unless I tear into something or am torn into. Inside my rib cage, the sun is barreling around my heart at a thousand rotations a minute. My instincts make me seek intense sensory and mental/emotional input as if it would somehow satisfy this ineffable want. It's harder not having a boyfriend to render me senseless.

Is this part of BD? The reasons I think it might not be hypomania is that I slept well last night and that it's only been a day. Another reason is that I've been able to keep it mostly in my head. I try to not bother people around me.

But, do many people get that special feeling? It's so strong. Do you also find that if you give into the voiceless thing telling you that you MUST DO SOMETHING, it makes you even more manic? Like, if you give into going for a walk instead of going to bed, instead of going to bed after the walk, you're going to want to go for a night drive to Monterey so you can wake up next to the sea, only to end up driving to Monterey, and throwing yourself into the ocean so it can eat you alive instead of sleeping in your car by the ocean?

Ok so at work, we have this thing every year. On New Yearâ€™s Day, we choose our One Word of the year to live by. Last year it was â€œlearnâ€, this year I chose â€œappreciate.â€

I have such a hard time showing appreciation for anybody. I have depression and anxiety and in the past had suicidal thoughts. I met a guy maybe 3 months after I broke up with my mentally manipulative and psychologically abusive ex who maxed out my credit cards. I was ready to end things once and for all but I couldnâ€™t because I knew it would absolutely crush my family. I met this guy and we had a unique first meet at Whataburger. We had our first date a week or so later and went to see Captain America Civil War. I didnâ€™t even like superhero movies. But I went. 

I found out he wasnâ€™t well, mentally, and I wasnâ€™t either. I think our mutual feeling of being ready to give up, connected us a little more and we both realized that we didnâ€™t want to lose the other. We fought our inner demons together. 

That was about this time, 3 years ago. 

Dates passed, traditions were created and now here in 2 months we are about to celebrate our first year of marriage. 

He knows I appreciate him, I tell him daily, or try to at least but I just wanted to shout it to the world how much I appreciate him. Sounds lame, right? Whatever. 

I do still have my dark days, I know he does too, but this man has changed my life and I am so happy. Heâ€™s given me my life back and heâ€™s given me back my old self that I missed so much.

 i didn't know how bad i was until i saw my younger brother talking and walking with my other brother, i saw him talking to him be he hadn't talked to me for days. so i got my razor and went into my brother's room and threatened to cut myself right in front of his face just to control him and so he would keep talking to me, he's fucking 14 and i legit was trying to make him talk to me by threatening myself. and when everything was over, i felt horrible. i hate feeling like i'm losing control of someone bc i feel like if i can't control them they'll eventually leave me and i fucking hate that feeling so fucking much. but i feel like i'm evil and get worse and worse everyday.

mentalhealth,01/04/2019,Jinshushei,b82mcb,2,1,"Cannot stay focused, need solutions Hello.

&amp;#x200B;

This is actually the first time I've ever posted on Reddit but I'm looking for some answers about focus attention issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 27, have a wife and a 1 year old with a stable blue collar job.  I life live with lots of regrets, such as not finishing college or getting any degree period.  I kind of fell into the lifestyle of blue collar work because I never could focus straight near the end of high school and especially into college.  I've tried to get remedies for this problem but they always end up in prescriptions (tried anxiety medication and it was like ten-fold worse).

&amp;#x200B;

To elaborate on the problem, whenever I'm sitting down or having a conversation with someone that isn't 100% casual, my mind wanders elsewhere almost immediately.  I recognize the problem, but if I try to fight what my brain is telling me to do, I get this internal feeling of ""I can't do this right now, you need to peace out ASAP"".  Even finding the courage to write this has been difficult because I consider it ""work"", although it's not.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example is exactly that, if I consider something ""work"", I just cannot find the willpower to start nor finish.  If I have to write a paper or do a resume, even if some of these things are considered hobbies, I give up almost immediately because I get that ""feeling"" that I just CANNOT sit there and do the ""work"".  This was my problem in college especially since it's nothing BUT that, hence why I stopped going and fell into this field of work I never really enjoyed.

  
In conversations, the issue is still there.  I'm a bad story teller because I lose train of thought rapidly and I always just ""want to get to the finish"" so I end up telling terrible short stories with people and I think people recognize my social ineptitude based off that and other factors such as changing subject randomly during mid-conversation.  I appreciate my wife, but sometimes when she's talking, almost immediately I want to change subject to something that just so happened to pop into my head.  I can carry a conversation most of the time but it has to be super endearing or something I can totally relate with.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I have ADHD, but I'm sure i have a form of ADD.  I used to actually be a straight A student as a kid and could always focus on my work but as I got older this issue got worse and worse.  I couldn't focus in school worth a damn on any project and it just spiraled out of control.  I'm not sure how to explain this to a doctor; I've tried and they just look at me confused but it's been affecting my life for many years and I want it to go away.

&amp;#x200B;

mentalhealth,01/04/2019,minimalist_rina,b82r3k,12,5,"Have my 1st appointment with psychiatrist today My therapist referred me to see a psychiatrist for medication. This is my 1st time seeing a psychiatrist, not really sure what to expect. 

My main concerns currently are:

1.) I have this fear that someone is out to get me/someone is out to hurt me. I had plans this weekend with my bf and friends and I canceled because I didn't want to leave my house because I was paranoid. So this whole weekend, I barely even left my bedroom. 

2.) Personal hygiene...I try to shower everyday, but sometimes I just don't have the energy to. It literally takes alot out of me to brush my teeth/shower. 

3.) I either over-sleep or don't get enough sleep. It's not consistent. 

4.) I have a strong suspicion that I have a personality disorder (BPD) rather than a mood disorder (my therapist diagnosed me as Bipolar II). So how can a medication for mood disorder do me any good if I am actually suffering from a personality disorder? 

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons why I think I have BPD:

1. I tend to value / devalue ppl based on my interaction with them. If I like someone, I put them on a pedestal, but if they do anything to hurt me, or make me question them, then it's like they're dead to me. Its always been either all good or all bad with me, like there's no grey area. 
2. I can be super obsessive/possessive/clingy in my relationships. So possessive to the point that I've had my bf block some of his female friends on social media due to my jealousy issues. 
3. When I meet new ppl/new friends/new relationships - I tend to take on their hobbies, their likes/dislikes, their slang, lingo
4. Anytime my boyfriend is upset, I take it personally and think that he's upset with me (even if he's not) and I start to think that he's gonna leave me and then I start getting thoughts about ending the relationship so I don't get hurt by him breaking up with me first but that also stirs up my abandonment issues. There's been times when I've broken up with him only to beg &amp; plead him to take me back because I hate being alone. 
5. Paranoia - constantly think that ppl, even strangers are talking shit behind my back, they have bad thoughts about me, ppl are out to hurt me. Again this could even be b/c a stranger looked at me and I thought he/she looked at me weird, and that's when I start feeling this way. 
6. I can have an explosive rage if someone either says or does something to irritate me. I usually feel bad after going off on someone and I do feel apologetic afterwards.

mentalhealth,01/04/2019,kfgoodd,b83b1k,9,2,"I need advice on what to do with my step daughter TL:DR - 14 y/o step daughter is determined to hurt herself or tear our family apart. Tried everything we can think of to help her and reconnect but it keeps getting worse. Looking for advice. 

My husband and I have been together for ten years married for less than a year. When we first met he had custody of one of his two daughters, we will call her CeCe. She was four, cute and fun. After two years of dating we moved in together. That's when things got harder, her behavior changed. We addressed it with counseling but it didn't seem to have much effect. When my husband's younger daughter who has autism came to live with us when CeCe was eight all hell broke loose. She began lying, telling people we abused and neglected her, broke into a neighbor's home, skipped school, and threatened another child with a knife all in the course of a year. We doubled down on treatment and therapy but to this day we have never been given an official diagnosis for her. Since that time her behavior has continued to escalate. She has been hospitalized at least three times for attempted suicide, she's run away, she goes online to talk to boys and men and tries to get them to take her in, she is trying to lose her virginity, and she has turned us in to cps on false allegations four times. She had become violent with us and verbally abusive. She abuses her siblings as well. 

The most recent episode was yesterday, we discovered she had stolen her autistic sister's tablet to Snapchat with her boyfriend and friends. Telling them we didn't feed her and she had to walk three miles to go to the store to get food for the kids or they would all starve. We have gone to great lengths to keep her off the internet due to her risky behavior online but she always seems to find a way. I don't know how to connect with her. Its clear that she is angry but no one can figure out why outside of her parents divorce when she was three. Her last hospital stay she told the staff she has been sexually abused when she was seven, but a forensic investigator questioned her and determined that it was a false claim.  I just want to have a normal life that doesn't involve polce, cps, and hospitals every month. I love her and I want her to be happy. I don't know how to make this work. Our only options left to us are institutionalize her or place her in foster care. 

I am really afraid of what is going to happen when she is supposed to get out of school. She might not come home again, she might report us to the school for ""abusing"" her again, she might try to hurt herself again. This is the pattern: she gets in trouble for something and the next day she acts out in one of the ways described.

Anyone who has any experience with this as a parent or from CeCe's perspective please give me some advice on what to do. I do not want to see her in a hospital, group home, or foster care. We love her and we want her here but we can't keep our three other children safe in the current circumstances and are running out of options. Our only family member who could take her on has just been diagnosed with cancer so we have no one to help us. Her bio mom hasn't been in the picture for eight years and is addicted to heroin and meth, so she isn't an option.

mentalhealth,01/04/2019,Beausoleil86,b83zcj,0,1,"Disappointing discussion with doctor So my meetings with doctors usually goes 2 ways.

1. They recognize my problem with anxiety and depression, so they go right to discussing medication
2. They analyze my living situation and tell me cats cure depression

Today was the 2 type of meeting. I'm being sarcastic on the cat bit, but it's the second time a doctor has asked me ""But don't your cats make you happy?"" Yes, they make me happy. Very happy. They're one of my reasons to live. But they don't take away my depression and anxiety.

Every time we talk about my support in life I feel it's always the same discussion. I tell them people leave me because my anxiety and depression overwhelms them. As much as I try to control it, it regularly spills over because I get triggered easily by abuse from my past. I tell myself to only contact friends when I'm in a good mood so I don't overwhelm them, but my depression and anxiety never gives me a relief. It's every day, 24/7. I can only fall asleep listening to documentaries so my mind won't go into haywire.

The help I was hoping to get from the doctor was medication that could help ease the overwhelming feelings my depression and anxiety gives me, so I can focus on other things. Even when I tell myself I don't need to feel bad about something, my emotions about it are painful and my mind keeps telling me ""Yes, you do feel horrible about this."" But I've pretty much tried every medication they can give me, which the doctor told me. And I felt she implied that I was thinking medication was a magical fix that would take everything bad away. That's absolutely not what I expect. I'm overwhelmed by the feeling that my anxiety and depression will be this intense for the rest of my life. I don't want to live like this.

I've been denied therapy on several occasions, because it's deemed my anxiety is too high to focus. Usually when one subject is brought up, it triggers several other instances of abuse. I was in private therapy twice and the therapists refused to continue treatment because I overwhelmed them. The only help I'm receiving is a meeting with psychiatrist once a week. He's thankfully patient with me and we've been meeting for several years. He's retiring this summer and I know I won't get help after that. He knows that too. 

I feel frustrated. I feel like I'm doing everything I can to improve my situation and sometimes I feel I make things worse the harder I try. It's gotten to the point where I'm scared to get help because things like today's disappointment set me back so much. I see no point going to another doctor when I'm just going to waste their time about how I fail to keep a social life. No adjustments was made to my medication.

I have no reason to believe that anything has changed in his life recently. He is doing well at school, but regardless, this is something we have never put any pressure on him about. He seems the same as he has always been. He has never expressed suicidal thoughts or mentioned feeling depressed.

So, it came as a shock to me today when I received a call from the school to say that he had text one of his friends to say he wanted to â€˜end it allâ€™ last night. The school is rightly concerned and informed me so that I could talk to him and get him help should he need it.

He has gone to school today as normal and seems completely fine.

Part of me wants to believe that this could have been a text for attention as he hasnâ€™t spent as much time with the friend he text recently, but I know that mental health should always been taken seriously, so would never accuse him of this.

mentalhealth,01/04/2019,Vexania11,b85hh5,1,3,"Is This Normal? Is it normal in anyway to have continuous drastic changes in thoughts, emotions and perspective?

e.g.
One week (or day if I'm unlucky) I will have a positive look on people and life, I have the will to help anyone in need and dont mind taking a bullet for anyone. I see reason in peoples thinking and accept them for who they are. After that duration it entirely changes. I'm indifferent, I am judgmental, I think about harming people and think incredibly toxic things about them (even if they're family). I dont bother to care or understand their thinking because my own thinking is all that matters. Everything I do is for the sake of me.

The same goes on with my gender strangely, one duration I am completely fine with being female and my confidence is boosted super high. On other days I feel male, this is where my ego goes low and I feel super insecure. 

Sometimes I battle with nihilism, and other times I feel happy with life and end up thinking that my darker times were just a phase. It's almost as if I feel like a different person with each change. 

I tend to treat people differently as well.
In my more positive mood I treat them with affection and dont mind telling people how much I love them.
In my more negative mood I openly judge them, I ignore their needs to vent and generally have a distaste in their opinions, interests and company.

Whenever I'm so negative with people I get so upset with myself when I'm positive again. I've tried to change myself a few times, but I always end up not caring about changing and returning to being an asshole.

When I'm in my negatives I usually forget what it's like to think nicely due to how indifferent I am. 

These things make me entirely confused on what my personality actually is. I've come to think that maybe I'm just a shitty person trying to play it nice. And it also brings difficulty within romantic relationships. But this has gone long enough.

Seb - does the video and audio editing

Joel â€“ helps research and script and find video material

happy,02/04/2018,Materia_Girl,8900x3,0,9,"A voice actor I like was really nice to me This happened a while ago but I was thinking about it and wanted to share.

Each year the past few years I've gone to a convention where Vic Mignogna was a guest. He does this adorable panel where he's... Just... He's a total dork, and it's endearing, and he's very sweet. I love him. Some of my friends can't stand him or think he's awful, but he's just so sweet. And he voices a ton of characters I like!

This last year I went to his signing by myself. I had a blu-ray art cover and I decided to buy a photo from him to have signed. I was thinking in line about how sweet he is at his panel and some of the things he says and how much I just love some of his characters (Junpei from Persona 3 and Tamaki from Ouran High School Host Club) and almost tearing up in line about it.

So it's my turn, and he says hi, and takes my stuff, and he asks who he's signing the photo for. The photo is a headshot of him, with the character next to him.

Important to note: The character in question is from an anime about a poor girl in a prestigious private academy who becomes indebted to a club of boys who basically host parties for girls who fawn over them, and since she was mistaken for a boy at first, works in the club. It's not the manliest show out there, and I'm a guy. The character he voices is ""the prince type"" who acts like he's a regal poet type and treats girls like princesses. 

So I say, me!

And he seems surprised, I could tell. And he instantly owns it, and is very excited, appreciating a male fan. I tell him I see him every year and love Ouran and his panel and that I was kinda getting emotional in line about it. He asks my name so he can sign the picture.

He signs it, and as he does, he says ""from Tamaki, your prince"" in the characters voice and gives me a big smile. :)

It made my weekend for sure. He was so nice and I love that he went as far as to be in character and try (and succeed) to make me all flustered and swoon like the girls in the show. I loved it!

happy,04/04/2018,Regnes,89m3d5,6,99,"8 years ago I was an unemployable loser walking into an interview with Tim Hortons. This week I was offered a franchise with the company. I was 22, with a high school education that wouldn't get me into any decent college program without having to basically redo all my academics since I was a horribly lazy student. I quit my job at McDonalds after high school so I could just play World of Warcraft for 2 years and change.

When I quit World of Warcraft and was ready to start being an adult, it was a difficult time to say the least. It was during the recession and my resume was just crap, especially with the several years in between my last job and present day. I eventually got in with a government program that would offer incentives to entry level employers for several months for hiring me. To this end I was  eventually hired by Tim Hortons.

I quickly gained a reputation as a star employee. I excelled at customer service in particular, and it was only several months later that I received my first commendation from the head office in Ontario. A rare feat almost no employee will ever achieve, I've received three.

Today I am now the restaurant manager. And earlier this week the store owners sat me down to talk about their plans for the future. In a few years they will retire and I am to be offered the franchise when that day comes.

I'm terrified of the prospect, but I'm just so happy at the same time. I took a longer more challenging path, and I made so many wrong decisions along the way, but I finally made it. I'm also happy that I can continue doing what I enjoy without being considered a lower level worker.",,1636, years ago unemployable loser walking interview tim hortons week offered franchise company high school education get decent college program without basically redo academics since horribly lazy student quit job mcdonalds high school could play world warcraft years change quit world warcraft ready start adult difficult time say least recession resume crap especially several years last job present day eventually got government program would offer incentives entry level employers several months hiring end eventually hired tim hortons quickly gained reputation star employee excelled customer service particular several months later received first commendation head office ontario rare feat almost employee ever achieve received three today restaurant manager earlier week store owners sat talk plans future years retire offered franchise day comes terrified prospect happy time took longer challenging path made many wrong decisions along way finally made also happy continue enjoy without considered lower level worker

happy,04/04/2018,gettinbuK,89moza,1,7,"After many bad relationships, I have finally found the one!! Before I start there might be some dumb metaphysical shit in here, I just wanna preface that I take it with a grain of salt.

My self esteem I guess has never been really good. I never had the self respect that demanded others to treat me the same, so I was constantly letting my previous boyfriends take advantage of my love. There was the two year relationship where he would lie to his ""friends"" that we were just friends (we definitely were dating, spent all our time together, extremely co-dependent relationship) among many many many other messed up things. Then there was the opiate addict who could barely take care of himself let alone a relationship. After that I took a relatively long break between relationships. I grew myself a ton as a person, grew my self esteem and figured out that I am worth WAY more than the shit I was dealing with. I guess that's one huge reason why I am so happy now. I am at peace with myself.

Anyways, I honestly I didn't think I would find someone so similar to me in the current town I'm living (way different culture from me) and I met this dude on Tinder. After a few messages I had the strongest feeling that he was the one, it was weird. We eventually meet up. We were supposed to get brunch together, but the night before he asks if I wanted to get drinks because he was trying to avoid a bday party. I agree because my friends were out of town for a concert I really wanted to go to but work got hectic and I was unable to go. I got there 20 minutes early to get a drink down because I was super nervous. I brought him a crystal to give him and a polaroid camera to take a picture later. He says now that I was quiet at first but I don't think I was! Anyways convo goes well and we go to another bar and we are sitting on the couch laughing and having a good time. I snap a picture of us and give it to him. We go back to his place and go to sleep. Next morning we go to brunch and he says ""I have never liked a girl so quickly"".

I went to spend the night a couple nights later and for some reason I could not sleep, I just felt like I was vibrating. I was so happy, I felt like my soul knew his soul. I just had the strongest feeling that this was it. The next day I wrote him a letter telling him how weird it sounds but I felt like our souls knew each other. I sealed it because I didn't want him to open it until he felt like he was ready for weirdness... So he takes me out to dinner that evening and I give him the letter and tell him to open it when he feels ready. He asked if it was okay if he opened it right there and I was nervous but I said okay. He read it and said he was happy I wrote that and that he felt very strongly about me too and we became a thang right there.

He's perfect for me. I have never felt like I have been listened to my partners in the past at all. He is literally a psychologist so that is his job and he listens to me so well. He is extremely genuine and I can trust him with everything. I am not used to my SO being thoughtful towards me, but he will remember all sorts of small stuff about me that lets me know he cares. I am working on my PhD and he has his so he understands how much I have to work. We have a ton of the same interests such as board games (he let me join his Gloom Haven group!), food and cooking (we both randomly love Budget Bytes), hiking and camping, music (well everyone has this in common ha), Reddit, idk a lot...

We went camping together and we went on a hike and on the way down we stopped to watch the sunset and I was really soaking it in and meditating.

happy,04/04/2018,Scorpiodej,89p9z4,1,31,"I am finally fitting in the black jeans I bought two years ago. FYI: I am not overweight, never was but my body was always something I struggled with. Weight is a journey for everyone, this is mine.

When I was 14 yo I weight a whooping 38kg (around 84 pounds) which for my height was extremely underweight (you could see my ribs). I wasn't anorexic I just didn't like food due to having a extreem case of the stomach flu the year before. I would eat but only 3 meals each day. 

I gained a bunch of weight in the past 8 years to about 67 kg (148 pounds) which was good for my height but I wasn't happy. My pants went up a size and I grew boobs (the last one I am happy about).

The last few months I didn't feel like eating a lot (I do still eat but I don't snack anymore, my dinners are still big and elaborate) and only ate if someone put something in front of me. 

My weight went down to about 63 kg (139 pounds) and I couldn't be happier. Want to lose another 3 kg (6,5 pounds).

But I just tried a set of jeans I bought in my old size and they FIT! I am so happy :)",,1072, finally fitting black jeans bought two years ago fyi overweight never body always something struggled weight journey everyone mine yo weight whooping kg around pounds height extremely underweight could see ribs anorexic like food due extreem case stomach flu year would eat meals day gained bunch weight past years kg pounds good height happy pants went size grew boobs last one happy last months feel like eating lot still eat snack anymore dinners still big elaborate ate someone put something front weight went kg pounds happier want lose another kg pounds tried set jeans bought old size fit happy
