mentalhealth,01/05/2019,neko-berry,bjamk0,5,1,"Treatment... is there really a cure for chronic MDD? I am stuck; what should I do from here? Hi all, just wondering if anyone could help me come to a decision about what to try next, as I am really stuck. This is going to be kinda long because there are some complicated factors, but I hope someone will have some time to hear me out and perhaps throw a few ideas at me.  


First, some context for my situation: I grew up with family violence, an alcoholic parent and a violently aggressive sibling, which means that I had ongoing exposure to regular traumatic experiences as a kid. In addition to this, I seem to have a much more sensitive personality than the others in my family, my emotions and experiences were usually ignored/overlooked/dismissed because of other things going on. I was basically ""on my own"" all through childhood, I had no adults for support, no safe places to go (except for school when I was little; as I got older school also became an unsafe place because I was bullied).  No doubt all of this stuff set me up for depression which set in during my early teens. I was diagnosed at 19 with depression, went on my first medication at around 20 (fluoxetine). I'm now in my early 30s. The most prominent psychological symptoms tend to be that I hate myself, I feel I'm an inferior person to everyone else, I'm never good enough, have a REALLY harsh inner critic etc. In a nutshell, I guess I wasn't raised in an environment that let me learn I'm an OK person and that I am loved. Instead my mind became very self-hating. Physical symptoms tend to be that sleep a hell of a lot, and feel tired and fatigued all the time.  


Most recently in my life I have been diagnosed with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, by my local hospital's mental health department. Since my early 20s I have tried a bunch of the SSRIs (fluoxetine, citalopram, venlafaxine, sertraline, escitalopram, and some others I can't remember) and none of them have been all that satisfactory. Some of them I couldn't stay on for long because I couldn't cope with the side effects. I recall fluoxetine being great to begin with and then ""pooping out"" after a year or so. Because I was scared of going on really high doses of it, I opted to start trying different medications. A bunch of meds didn't agree with me, and in my mid-late twenties I was on sertraline. I found that out of all of them, sertraline really gave me the best mood boost most of the time, and I think a bit of an energy boost as well. 

About a year and a half ago I went to my doctor and told her I wanted to find a drug that would work but wouldn't cause the sexual side effects I have (which is, basically no sex drive and no ability to orgasm). I am married and have been on antidepressants pretty much my entire marriage, so we have not really ever had a time that we enjoyed a loving and active sex life together. My doctor switched me to escitalopram to give that a try. I think it made me tireder than sertraline ever did, and I don't believe it improved my sex drive at all. She looked into more options for me and decided to refer me to a psychiatrist at the hospital, plus a therapist because I was having really bad bouts of depression still. So currently I've been trying some different meds with the approval of my psychiatrist; last year I tried a combination of escitalopram and aripiprazole (Abilify) which was meant to help get my sex life back and give me some more energy. Aripiprazole was HORRIBLE to start up on (I had migraines and fainting), and then once I was on it for a while I found it didn't do anything for my energy, and only a very little for the sexual side of things (my orgasms came back but they were SO DULL). Most recently my psychiatrist let me try bupropion (Wellbutrin to some of you). I had really high hopes for it because I've read about it helping sexual side effects and energy levels. I came off escitalopram completely before starting bupropion. I was on bupropion for 4 weeks, and stopped about a week ago because I just can't tolerate how fast it makes my heart beat. My anxiety also went way up and I found myself constantly fretting about my daughter's wellbeing (I kept convincing myself she was going to stop breathing at night, or that any mild symptom of illness meant she was going to die). I got so jittery and worried about things that I just decided to stop. The ONE good thing about bupropion though is that it helped my energy levels amazingly, and my sex drive went back to normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this is where I'm stuck. I am currently not taking ANYTHING, and I don't know if I should continue taking nothing, go back to sertraline, or try something new. In the past I have attempted to come off medication, and failed miserably. I thought then that it was my depression relapsing, BUT I know now that it could have been withdrawal symptoms that made me feel so bad. I have read these symptoms can last for months for some people. Currently I have been off escitalopram for about 5 weeks, and off bupropion for 1 week. I could still be at risk for withdrawal effects impacting on my mood. I am feeling okay, but have found myself feeling more ""doom and gloom"" about life (anxiety about everything, I've been more teary and crying, I've been more irritable etc). I'm certainly not as ""happy"" or coping with things as well as I was on sertraline. I am worried about the potential consequences of having untreated depression. My daughter is three, and needs a loving and caring mother; I am worried about the impact of my mood on her psyche. Also about the impact on my relationship with my husband and friends/family. 

My hesitancy to try something new (which would be tricyclics) is that I am SO SICK of going through all the starting/stopping symptoms associated with trying new meds. Also the disappointment of yet another one not working out. I think I may have even mentally 'primed' myself to expect failure, and I'm not sure if that affects my overall results with any of the meds. Also I know that with tricyclics they have even MORE side effects than SSRIs do, and I don't think ANY of them come without the sexual side effects. I really just don't see the point in trying another med.

My hesitancy to go back on sertraline is that even though I know it probably gave me the best mood boost, I KNOW it will take me back to having a dead sex drive, and I hate that. What is the point in having a sexless relationship with my spouse. I know that sex isn't everything but it is an important part of a romantic relationship. I know that many sexless marriages end up being cold and distant or they just, well, end. This in itself contributes to depression.

  
I just want a treatment that will allow my body to continue working as it should, and I don't feel any of my medication options allow me that. I want to return to work soon, so I also don't want to be back on anything that's going to make me really tired.   


Is there hope for MDD \*without\* medication? I mean I have read a lot of stories of people who say they ""beat depression"" without medication, but were they suffering from chronic major depression and anxiety? I should mention I researched and tried a bunch of supplements in the past but none of them helped me as much as SSRIs did. Would intense therapy help me be happier? How do I train my brain to stop hating on me and instead be more loving? Would that give me more stable feelings? I'm not looking to feel happy all the time, but to have more of a sense that life isn't frightening and that I am actually capable of functioning as a normal human being on society. I have an opportunity to train for my dream job soon and I don't want to fuck it up because of my mental and emotional instability.

My self esteem has been at an all time low. I feel as if I cannot succeed in any job given to me.

In the past, I have abused stimulants for recreational use and studying purposes. I told my psychiatrist this and she told me that I can only be prescribed stimulant medication after 6 months of being drug-abuse free. I have been using non-stimulant medication to treat ADHD, but it has not worked as well as I would hope.

I am also hoping that the stimulant medication will help with the negative mood symptoms of bipolar disorder. I take lithium to stabilize my mood and it has helped but I still feel depressed.

mentalhealth,01/05/2019,orbittal,bjarwb,0,1,"Friendships and social interaction fading for no apparent reason. Advice much appreciated. **Background:** I am near the end of my second year of college, and while I was incredibly depressed / mood-swingy / anxious last year, I've had it under much better control this year (especially after figuring out an antidepressant that seems to work well ... not all the time, but certainly better than being on nothing). In the past, people have viewed me as introverted, but I have realized this year that what I (and other people apparently) thought to be introversion was just a combination of social anxiety and depression. The better my mental health got, the more I realized that I believe myself to be an extroverted person in the sense that I love interacting and connecting with people.  I truly felt like myself at college first time this year. That being said, I believe I have an insecure, anxious attachment style (something that I learned about in one of my classes, actually; this means that I have a strong desire to be close to others, but fear that others won't respond to this desire). The more the school year went on, the more I tried to start conversations with people and I was really happy for a little while around a few months into the school year. 

**Currently:** However, for a few months now, I have felt that the connections that I was forming throughout the first half or so of the school year were beginning to fade away. I would still try to talk with and hang out with people, but they began to seem more and more uninterested in interacting with me. I live in a suite of six people including myself, and I used to hang out in our common room (nice shared living room with a couch and chairs, table, a TV, gaming consoles, etc.) with them all the time, and it was a really great time. However, practically every time I am in the common room now and someone enters the suite, they either go straight to their room or leave the suite soon after to go hang out with other people (many of whom are people I know too). I frequently ask my suitemates if they want to go to dinner or lunch with me, and they often ask each other too, but they almost never ask me, even when I am in the suite or in the same room as they are. They threw a birthday party and/or dinner for everyone in the suite except for me, and often push me into buying alcohol for the parties that I am only partially ever paid back for. 

When other people who I thought were my friends enter the suite, they sometimes just poke their head in and see I'm the only one there, and then they just leave without saying a word or giving me a chance to say hello. The most interaction I get with these people now is them coming in, asking if another one of my roommates is there; if I say yes, they go to his room and close the door, and if I say no, they just leave. 

At dinner, I find that even when I try to get in on conversations or start new ones, I am sometimes straight up ignored and will have to repeat myself, other times people will just briefly acknowledge that I said something and then continue talking to one another. And I know this sounds like I am just not being active enough in the conversation, but I have noticed that people will hardly even look me in the eyes anymore even when I'm trying to be part of their conversation. Like, when I talk to them they will never address me directly, and will even often respond to things I said by saying something to a different person. 

I always try to join in when I have the chance to hang out or do something with people, but while my suitemates are constantly invited to do things with other people, I don't think anyone (aside from my friend from high school who is also here) has asked / invited me to do anything with them in so long.

To make things worse, most of my suitemates decided to make housing plans for next year together without even asking me. The details are hard to explain, but essentially their decision to do so forced me into my absolute last option: living in a double for a third year in a row with a random transfer student roommate, in a suite of people I sort of know but have never gotten along with, located in the farthest position possible from the other people in my year. 

**TL;DR:** Second year of college ending, my mental health is better this year and I was much more social/happy for first half of year, but now all my ""friends"" seem to be avoiding me // completely disinterested in me. I am feeling extremely lonely and spend hardly any time with friends anymore, not by choice.

**Questions:** Why do the people I once got along with great seem to avoid me at all costs now? Should I keep trying to be friends with them, or say fuck them and let them drift out of my life and try to find new friends? Why do most other people here seem to be much better-liked than I am and have many more friends than I do? Am I doing something wrong / viewing the situation inaccurately? I am ready and willing to do things differently, but I honestly feel powerless over my own happiness right now.

mentalhealth,01/05/2019,MassEffectedN7,bjazra,15,2,At one point in my life I was hearing voices. Sometime in beginning to middle of 2017 I had an experience where I was hearing voices like people talking. I believed there were people outside my house talking about me. This went on for about 2 or 3 months before I was taken to a hospital. In the hospital I was still hearing voices of people talking and it was the same voices. I thought there was a microphone or camera in the hospital room where people were watching me. The doctor prescribed me seroquel and I was discharged. I was happy to be home and never wanted to go back to the hospital. A few weeks went by and I heard voices  again. Hearing the same things of people talking about me like they were outside my house. Again I was taken to a hospital. This time a different hospital. In the hospital I still heard voices of people talking about me. Then I figured out it was the air conditioner in the room that somehow made me think it was people talking. This is strange because I also have an air conditioner in my room at home and that could also have made me think I was hearing people talking. The doctor at the hospital gave me invega and Effexor and I was discharged. I was happy to be home again. This time I didnâ€™t hear any more voices. I went to outpatient therapy which I am still going to and I see a psychiatrist who prescribed me invega. I no longer hear voices and I havenâ€™t heard voices since late 2017 or early 2018. Even though my psychiatrist has been prescribing me invega for about a year now I do not take the medication as prescribed. I take it at night and it makes me drowsy the next day and I have to work all day itâ€™s very difficult to go through one day at work feeling drowsy I dread going through it everyday so I do not take the medication. So I donâ€™t take the medication and I donâ€™t hear the voices. Iâ€™m wondering if this was something that was caused by social isolation and being out of work because I was isolated for a long time before I heard voices and went to hospitals. Could this be a misdiagnosis of schizophrenia and it could have been caused by social isolation? Keep in mind I was 34 years old at the time and I never had this experience before in my life Iâ€™m 35 now and havenâ€™t heard voices since then. I hate taking this medication cause of the drowsy feeling and I feel like I really donâ€™t even need it. The doctor says that itâ€™s an illness and there is no cure. Iâ€™m thinking itâ€™s a misdiagnosis. Another thing that bothers me is that this has probably affected my medical records which will effect my career because Iâ€™m planning on getting a CDL next year. If this is a misdiagnosis can I dispute the medical records and have them changed so they donâ€™t say I have schizophrenia or whatever they wrote down?

He sees signs everywhere, especially in numbers (number plates, time of day etc).

I feel like most people would probably consider this as a blessing, but it just makes me feel like I'm about to play Russian roulette. Problem is, I live in an area where mental healthcare workers are infamous for mistreating patients and being able to get away with it due to the lax mental healthcare laws we have. I'm not interested in trying antidepressants, and I doubt I ever will be, but it's completely legal for a psychiatrist to ram them down my throat if they simply felt like it, regardless of whether or not I'm actually a threat to myself. And they can legally force me into continuing to take it for an indefinite amount of time, regardless of how it affects me. Needless to say, it's pretty unnerving. 

I've been trying to keep my medical record clean of any mention of mental health issues in order to prevent judgement from doctors and such, and haven't even bothered seeing anyone for it since I was a minor, but it always seems to follow me around.

mentalhealth,01/05/2019,lalechuganormal,bjc7ax,1,2,"How to approach talking to my (adult) sibling about (his) depression? Posting this on my throwaway account.

I guess the short version is that I (20F) and kind of worried about my brother (24M).

Iâ€™ve kind of had suspicions that he has depression for a while now, but have felt powerless to address it. Especially since our relationship is usually about nagging each other or ranting endlessly about whatever shows/games/etc weâ€™re currently into despite the fact the other person knows nothing about it.

We definitely donâ€™t talk about feelings lol.

My own mental healthâ€™s been kind of bad for years as well, but Iâ€™m finally starting to feel a bit more positive and clear headed finally, and to top it off I finally brought myself to schedule a therapy appointment week after Monday to ensure I donâ€™t start going downhill again.

Honestly, I feel like he should go to therapy, but it seems inappropriate to just up and suggest it.

Some other context: A couple years ago, he dropped out of college to start working at a theme park because he stopped attending classes (heâ€™s always been super smart and hard working and all his high school classmates saw him as this super ambitious guy). He lived with my dad and stepmom for a while after, and they helped him get an actual office job, but when they tried to nudge him toward moving out and taking more control over his life, he got kind of aggressive (due to long standing issues from their divorce) and moved out.

Heâ€™s now living with my mom, who financially speaking canâ€™t really afford to support him long term, especially since almost two years ago he lost his job (fired for falling asleep too much on the job as a result of him never getting near enough sleep). He hasnâ€™t worked since. He did take an online class once at my momâ€™s insistence but it never went anywhere. Right now he has no real aspirations other than gaming and hypothetical world building with his online friends. He has no IRL friends, eitherâ€”used to be in a D&amp;D group, but it fell apart.

My momâ€™s convinced heâ€™s on the autism spectrum despite the fact that when he was tested in high school the doctor said he didnâ€™t. Also, he doesnâ€™t really have any signs of autism outside of having both intelligence and asocial tendencies. Iâ€™m pretty sure heâ€™s just depressed (heâ€™s also texted me a couple of jokey depression memes. Not to say neurotypical people never laugh at/relate to those memes, but still, doesnâ€™t help).

My mom and brother currently live in a remote area where jobs are hard to get. My mom works, but itâ€™s a remote job that pays minimum wage.

She also has this fantasy that she and him will move out to live with me in the next few years and weâ€™ll all live together and heâ€™ll go to college again this time to be some sort of medical tech and everything will be okay. I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s realistic, since the area I live in is super expensive. The three of us would have to share a one bedroom apartment, considering that he wouldnâ€™t have a job and she only makes minimum wage.

Regarding my situation: Iâ€™m currently in college, soon to graduate, and with a job lined up. Needless to say, Iâ€™ve been super fortunate. Unfortunately, this also means that any conversation I initiate might be perceived as demeaning, especially coming from a younger sibling.

Any thoughts? I donâ€™t know how to approach the topic that I think the reason heâ€™s been out of a job with no aspirations for years is depression and that he should seek help (Skype therapy? Iâ€™d even be willing to help pay if needed but I canâ€™t see that offer going over well).

I called tons of places that have no one available. my PCP doctor gave me a referral, so I was trying to find somebody fast.

&amp;#x200B;

i settled for a MH clinic with a spanish name... which is ok because I am half puerto rican. So I ended up getting a psychiatrist that doesnt speak english but is learning. We started talking about my MH issues (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Schizoid Personality Disorder, PTSD, and Depression). The entire time she kept pointing out words on a piece of paper and asking me what they ment. The whole time I was talking, she kept nodding her head but I was unclear if she understood what I was saying. She asked me like 20 times if I was single, 10 times if I had a girlfriend, and 5 times if I was married. 

&amp;#x200B;

So as the session was over (closing time), she asks me to sign a paper, as I got off the chair to sign it... I farted without knowing it was coming! she then started rushing me out the door LOLOLOL

I couldnt stop laughing about it.

mentalhealth,01/05/2019,merrywar,bjdigc,1,2,"How can you tell if youâ€™re too hard on yourself due to your mental illness or if youâ€™re actually just a bad person? Question is the title. 

I feel so guilty about everything, all the time. I can rationalize my decisions and say I have good intentions, but â€œbadâ€ people do the same thing. How can you tell if youâ€™re a bad person who is taking advantage of othersâ€™ kindness or an okay person who has normal supportive relationships?

Even my anxiety about this is gross and toxic. I have to constantly stop myself from asking for reassurance about everything so I donâ€™t become a huge burden on the people I love. If I were a good person, wouldnâ€™t I just be doing good stuff without frantically trying to tally up my morality points to make sure Iâ€™m not manipulating everyone around me? What if my negative feelings and emotions arenâ€™t even real and theyâ€™re just excuses to control other people and get attention?

Posting this question in the mental health subreddit even feels like a shitty thing to do. Obviously Iâ€™m going to get a bunch of people being supportive! Is it just a way to avoid facing the consequences of being mean and lazy and inconsiderate? Is choosing those words manipulative because maybe theyâ€™ll make you latch onto them as way too hard on myself when theyâ€™re actually just all true? 

I got in a fight with my SO tonight because I interrupted him twice in a fun, spirited discussion. He snapped at me in frustration. I felt so bad about it that he ended up feeling terrible for snapping even though it wasnâ€™t a big deal. But I couldnâ€™t stop thinking that if I hadnâ€™t interrupted, he wouldnâ€™t have been frustrated. So it was my fault. But saying that made him sad. And I knew it would. So isnâ€™t even feeling upset and not just accepting an apology bad? 

I just feel really lost. I know I shouldnâ€™t say things are BAD, too. This is too long. Iâ€™m gonna end the post now. Iâ€™m sorry itâ€™s all over the place. Most of that was just stupid ranting.

Taking time off Iâ€™m probably not helping myself. I have an eating disorder which leads to low moods, anxiety, depression, fear of leaving the house to see people and I usually spend a great deal of time in bed unable to do anything. 

Lately I worry the worse outcome of me doing this is Iâ€™ll be fired. I worry people wonâ€™t like me or understand the struggle and weight of mental health problems.

mentalhealth,01/05/2019,olorin01,bje2h9,0,1,"Iâ€™m up at night thinking about shit and iâ€™m going to share bc it might help someone somewhere. (long) (but worth the read) To start this off (because a lot of people do this) Iâ€™m not writing this for pity or for upvotes or whatever, I just want to share my story and make it something that helps others. heads up this might start slow, bear it out.. When I was 15 I was a pretty average kid. I was a pretty happy kid, i played football and volleyball, had a good group of friends, got along with my family and got good grades. Around the end of my freshman year/ start of my sophomore year I got 3 pretty serious concussions in a 9 month period, adding on to a very bad one I got in middle school. This was also the time I smoked bud and drank for the first time. Suddenly sophomore year school got very bad. Unknown at the time I got ADD and Major Neurocognitive disorder (affects processing speed). I was used to effortlessly getting As or Bs and suddenly I was getting Câ€™s. It was a passing grade, but I go to a high preforming school and it felt like the end of the world. I used to be super hard on myself and bc of the low grades I developed a bad self critic (I call him simon cowell). Simon was me telling myself iâ€™m not good enough, iâ€™m bad at everything, no one likes etc. Depression and Anxiety started creeping in and at this time I was smoking week maybe once a month and drinking most fridays with friends. It gets worse and worse throughout the year and I have my first visit to the hospital, after trying tripping on benadryl  (yes thatâ€™s a thing) and freaking myself out. I was at this place that was nice but 100% useless for about a week then I went home. Things got worse and worse. I started drinking some week days and every weekend, smoking most days and starting to experiment with other drugs. Anxiety was big at this point and so I tried to drown it out with substances and depression was minimal. At this point my parents knew I was doing stuff and they were mad about it but they were afraid to approach me about it. Halloween in 2017 was a big point in my downward spiral. I was with a few friends drinking and having a pretty good time until maybe 10 at night. They leave and Im left with my anxiety and apathy and decide to text a dealer about what he has. He had just gotten a shipment of xanax and I had heard a lot about them so I got 10 of the green ones or â€œhulksâ€ and like two of a smaller dosage. That night I took the small ones while drunk (never a good idea) and blacked out for the night and until maybe 8am while I was at school. According to my sister I was acting normal but I had no recollection of any of that night. So I kinda come back into consciousness at school and am in a bad place. I hate my life, myself, just everything. Depression was bad, and at this point the anxiety and panic attacks I had morphed into a apathy where I had stressed so much suddenly i didnâ€™t care about consequences or people or myself. I donâ€™t want it to seem like iâ€™m glorifying drugs because yes itâ€™s funny looking back but I was seriously ducking up my life. The memory is a little fuzzy and 90% of this is from other peopleâ€™s filling in the blanks but I remember taking a few school, getting confused and missing my classes, eating lunch 3 times at different lunch periods, ending up at my friends house eating ramen two hours after school, then walking around my neighborhood and not much else. The filled in version is I tried like two of the hulks and kept saying didnâ€™t feel it during study hall then decided to take the rest in class (thank god the teacher never noticed, then being absolutely stupid the whole day at school. My friend drove me home and watched me, then my mom came to pick me up. I got really mad, left the car at a stop light, walked inside a gas station near my house for nearly 30 minutes and the guy convinced me to call my parents to have them pick me up. My parents decided to take me to my grandparents house a couple hours away to get me in a safe place for a while. I was conscious for the first 30 minutes but then I went into a comatose state where they couldnâ€™t wake me up. This is one of the hardest things to think about and one of the biggest regrets of my life because my 3 younger siblings were in the car with me and they had to watch their brother bar out then go to sleep and not wake up. My parents took me a hospital on the way where I was given an IV and they screened me for liver damage. You canâ€™t overdose and die on xanax (or atleast it would be very hard) but you can mess your liver up or cause other health problems. I had minor liver stuff so they kept me there overnight and then took me to my grandparents house. My memories had a full  24 hour gap between getting picked up and waking up in my grandparents house. I had no idea what happened, the xanax caused to forget what I had taken or done. My dad came in and started yelling at me (well deserved yelling) about how I had exposed my siblings to it and how I have such a problem and all that. I was not in a clear mind and hearing this shredded me. As soon as he left I tried to hang myself with an extension cord. This was my very first time feeling suicidal and I didnâ€™t know what to do and kind of tried then gave up and hid everything. Long story yes, but it shows how bad I had gotten. From there I was drinking pretty much every day, doing any drugs I could get my hands  on, verbally abusing my family by yelling and insulting, and skipping school. Of the second semester of my sophomore year I had 102/140 something days missed. I was very behind in school, I hated myself, hard everything around me, and was always drunk or high. Very low point. From November 2017-March 2018 I was in a psych ward 4 times, and a hospital twice for drug stuff. Late february I hit my breaking point. I stole two bottles of wine, drank a bottle in a half feeling sorry for myself, crying, and writing suicide letters. I wrote 26 letters that night all a page long. One for every birthday for all my siblings until theyâ€™re 18 and a few for my parents. I drank and thought and gave up. Iâ€™m gonna keep this PG but I grabbed a knife and really carved up my arms and legs. I had to get 93 stitches for 24 gashes on my forearms and right thigh and calf. I likely would have died that night but my dad woke up and checked on me. This is really hard to think about and re live because my dad had to walk in and find me in the bathtub, incoherent, in a bathtub full of bloody water. There was blood on the walls, carpet. I had gone to kiss all my siblings goodnight forever and left blood trails in their room before passing out in my bathtub. If I was any less drunk I likely wouldnâ€™t be here right now because I passed out and couldnâ€™t continue. This caused my last psych ward visit. February 2018 my parents sent me to a wilderness therapy program for several months and then a residential treatment center until january of 2019. I learned to love myself and to get rid of simon cowell. I started to find joy in the smallest things and those things got bigger. I met my two best friend to this day (even though they live in cali) and we rebuilt our lives together. The funny thing? I remember thinking that none of those things would happen, that life is hopeless and iâ€™m a sack of shit. I wanted to share my story because tonight I dug out some of those letters I wrote and started bawling my eyes out.  Because I was at that spot where I was willing to destroy my family to end the pain and for all the kids out there that are in the same spot that I was and feel hopeless and alone, and are close to their breaking point. Everyone has heard â€œitâ€™s going to be alright and itâ€™ll get betterâ€ and I always just blew those off like fuck off you donâ€™t know what iâ€™m going through. Well iâ€™m not going to say itâ€™s going to be alright because yeah shits going to suck but thereâ€™s life worth living out there you just gotta hold on a little longer.

Aside from the usually childhood trauma (sexual assault &amp; bullying) I have to deal with still new things have started happening that make me feel like the universe is trying to break me.
A year ago both of my grandparents died after not having seen them for 2 years due to waiting for my green card and I could only attend one of their funerals, where I had to witness the horrible part of my family tearing the house apart for valuable stuff, in the middle of grieving. My grandpa died of old age, my grandmother was run over mmby a car backing out, her body being dragged a few meters until the driver noticed that he had hit a person. This had haunted me in my nightmares for months. 3 Months after my grandmothers death I had an accident in which a fire work hit my eye, leaving my face scarred and ugly. I had to move my wedding ceremony because the accident happened months before it was planned.  And working with the eye patch on in a service position in a semi-fast food place has traumatized me to an extent I never thought possible. You'd be suprised how many people will make pirate jokes or ""did your BF beat you jokes"" or come up in the supermarket to harass you about it, when they see a person who is clearly hurt.
I'm starting to come to work late, I'm having trouble sleeping, waking up AND getting to work (my anxiety makes me too scared to actually miss work or call in). I've reached this point where I just want to stop existing, and if it wasn't for my husband and my beautiful pets I might have hurt myself already. I just feel so lost and hurt and I don't know how to cope with it anymore. I've been crying myself to sleep nearly every night, trying not to wake my husband, trying ti not have this conversation with him. I feel like I've reached my breaking point.

I've contacted my doctor to talk about getting therapy but I am really scared. Our insurance covers it, but I'm scared that I won't actually be able to admit to my problems because I tend to just bottle things up. I don't know how I can make it through the 2 weeks that I have left until the appointment. I Don't know if I can do it.

mentalhealth,01/05/2019,IncenseAndIron,bjf2wh,4,3,"Medication as a weapon Hey everyone.  Just going to rant and rave for a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm a 34 M diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety.  I have an extreme aversion to taking medication for it.  I've opted for other means to manage my mental sickness.  I practice Zen, I exercise, I take supplements (fish oil, a multivitamin, Saint John's Wort) and I try to avoid and control my triggers.  My therapist has been a massive help, but really wants to put me back on medication.  She says she's proud I made it this far, but with everything happening she thinks just a low dose of xanax would really help me.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate taking medication.  I've been off and on medication for my mental health since I was 12.  I got on it initially because the child shrink thought it would help me control my anger issues and emotional outbursts....which stemmed from vicious abuse by my peers.  That there is another story.    I have a massive issue with staying on medication because my family, some close friends, even my significant other, uses my medicine against me.  They take the fact that I'm medicated and it becomes a weapon any time I'm emotional for any reason.  A couple of examples:  I was having a really bad night at work.  Murphy's Law in full force.  I get home and have a bit of a tangent.  Nothing terrible.  Just ranting about how much my work atmosphere sucks.  The only thing my (now ex) girlfriend could say was ""Did you take your pills? You better take your pills.""  And that was every time I had a problem.  Upset cause I got pulled over and a ticket?  Take your pills.  My friend died and I was depressed?  Take your pills.  Someone at the bar took a swing at me and I'm not happy because of it? Take your pills. My dog is sick and its stressing me out? Take your pills.  I don't know how I'll make rent and it's giving me anxiety? Take your goddamned pills.

mentalhealth,01/05/2019,dcrose89,bjfasf,0,2,"My family doesnâ€™t listen to me and itâ€™s wearing me down. For the basics, Iâ€™m 29. I have bipolar disorder type 1 and generalized anxiety disorder, and theyâ€™re severe enough that three separate medical professionals have given written statements documenting my inability to work, due to my conditions. I live with my wife, who is currently unemployed, (and just got out of psychiatric inpatient care) and my mother (who is on disability.)

Theyâ€™ve recently taken it upon themselves to decide when I sleep, when I wake up, when I eat, when I shower, when I walk my motherâ€™s dog (because sheâ€™s currently awaiting ankle surgery and canâ€™t walk), when I go to the store, what I watch on tv, and theyâ€™ve even started telling me (together) that I should cut my hair like Jon Snow. (I donâ€™t want to cut my hair like Jon Snow.)

I have no autonomy and no authority over my own life. Iâ€™m forcibly woken up, then I stumble into the bathroom to pee and while Iâ€™m in there I get orders barked at me through the door. At the first sign of a moment of peace, I try to sit in the living room or lay on my bed and I can literally count down the seconds until they tell me to go do something. And since we recently moved in, most of what Iâ€™m asked to do involves moving and building heavy IKEA furniture by myself, as well as taking huge loads of cardboard and trash in the elevator to the dumpsters in the garage, and bringing all of the new packages and deliveries upstairs - the cycle begins anew. Or my wife will make me do small things like sheâ€™ll hand me something and say, â€œHold thisâ€ when she could just as easily have put it on the counter she was standing next to. It all adds up and overwhelms me.

To tell the truth, when my wife went to the hospital, before she was checked into inpatient psychiatric care, she only went because I needed to go and get checked in and she didnâ€™t want me to go alone. I was at my witâ€™s end and my meds werenâ€™t working anymore. But they didnâ€™t admit me. They admitted her instead. I was overwhelmed a month ago. Now Iâ€™m over-overwhelmed.

If Iâ€™m not stable enough to work 40 or even 20 hours a week, how the hell am I supposed to be â€œonâ€ 24/7 at home? I feel like a lackey. Completely unvalued. Unappreciated. And they make me feel guilty for asking for time to myself.

Saturday I got caught shoplifting from Ralphâ€™s of all things and got off ridiculously easy. Went out at midnight for a walk even though I know thereâ€™s coyotes everywhere at night. Sunday I shoplifted like 5 shorts from the mall that I donâ€™t even particularly like and some other shit, including a $65 dollar makeup palette even though Iâ€™m a guy that I just gave to a friend and a $90 bts  album thing just because of the high price tag and how easy it was to slip into a bag. Iâ€™ve stolen shit before because I was blacked out on benzos but I was completely sober these times. 

Iâ€™ve also been eating a fucking lot. I spent ~$50 on fast food last week alone compulsively. I have an eating disorder and Iâ€™m in sort of a binge/fast cycle. Today I realized I had literally $3 in the bank and no cash to buy food with. My kitchen is completely empty except for the shit my vegan boyfriend eats, fake bacon and peas and shit. I lost it. My boyfriend came home to me aggressively eating the last bit of pancake mix Iâ€™d bought a month ago with the questionably aged Nutella weâ€™d been avoiding. I asked him if he had money to order food but weâ€™re both broke as fuck from bills and shit. So I lost it some more. Started kicking shit and screaming when he tried to clam me down. I took my prescription xanax which is measly as shit (.25mg) and fucked up my thighs a lot. My bf cleared out of the house, Iâ€™ve had a few breakdowns like this before and he knows Iâ€™d rather be alone. 

Iâ€™ve eaten 3000+ calories today. Itâ€™s 3am right now and I feel like punching a wall because Iâ€™m hungry and itâ€™s making me pissed as fuck. I would go straight to my therapist but I fucking canâ€™t, Iâ€™m trans and considered â€˜high riskâ€™ for some suicide attempts like 6 months ago.

mentalhealth,01/05/2019,Waynerojo,bjgp6r,0,1,"Looking for advice dealing with my toxic behaviors Hello i am 20 years old and i don't know how to stop certain toxic behaviors i have. I believe they have damaged many of my friendships and i need to stop them. Im not sure if my motivation to better myself is for my own well being or so i dont lose my friends, probably somewhere in the middle tbh.

My worst behaviors are lying about small things and making up stories, playing the victim, i always find a way to pass my blame off. A bad one i used to have was telling friends when i felt suicidal, everyone feels this way sometimes but i would say it to get attention(ive gotten much better about this, things slip out but i dont go out of my way to say them). I'll get better about suppressing these things for a while but i eventually devolve back to them. I dont say much to my family they constantly try and seem to be patient but i often meet them with anger or hostility or just a general bad attitude. A lot of my friends have stopped trying, I'll ghost friends for months then i wont leave them alone for a few weeks of conversations which eventually lead to me talking about how shitty i am then starting the cycle again. Also finding things to lie about or play the victim in(I'll go more into these things if asked about specifics). 

Most recently a close friend of mine lost some special and i was hitting her up trying to talk about my problems with lying. I had already told her i was sorry about her loss and gave her some advice( Ive been through something similar a few months ago and i didn't handle it healthily at all, i recommended her to talk about it). This was very fucked up like shes in the middle of mourning a friend, i told her that was inconsiderate of me(no shit) i just dont understand how i can talk about stuff like that to a person going through loss. Tbh not sure if were still friends after this but i think I'd know if we werent.

Ive always done stuff like this, its the reason i end up ghosting people. I would rather them not deal with my shit you know? Then i start to miss them. Its a cycle at this point and i feel like the people that are still around deeply care about me and its only fair to them that i fix this stuff and be a good friend to them in return. Their happiness is what i want.

If anyone read this far im coming here for advice to stop these behaviors, i dont expect a magic answer to it all but any piece of knowledge would be helpful.

My mom is a wonderful person. Sheâ€™s loving, kind, considerate, everything a mom should be. 
But she has some serious mental health problems that she refuses to seek help for, and I donâ€™t know how to help her. 
We are complete opposites. Iâ€™m a fairly well balanced person. She has severe anxiety and I think bouts of depression. Her father was verbally/emotionally abusive when she was young. I think the majority of her issues boil down to that, and while I am *aware* of that, being that my family life has always been safe and supportive, I have a hard time *relating* to that. 
Basically, here are the biggest problems I run into with my mom:
She refuses to believe her kids love her. We tell her we love her. We try to be kind and do what she asks. Of course we fight, like all parents and kids do, but it feels like she takes the fights as meaning we donâ€™t love her, and forgets all the ways we try to show we do love her. 
She panics, instantly, about small things. I know this is common in people with anxiety, but I donâ€™t know how to help. If I need to drive somewhere in the rain or snow, she breaks down. If weâ€™re going to have a very busy weekend, she panics. I donâ€™t know why?
She does not believe she has worth. I know this is a byproduct of how her dad treated her, he constantly told her she was worthless. I guess I canâ€™t expect to change that completely, but is there a way I can help? 
I love her so much, but it gets really frustrating sometimes because she does not *listen*. It doesnâ€™t matter how much we try to say *and* show how much we all love her and what sheâ€™s worth to us. The second we have a fight, itâ€™s back to sheâ€™s worthless and canâ€™t do anything right. 
I admit sometimes I play the victim and feel like sheâ€™s being cruel and irrational. But I try to remind myself that she has genuine problems. If she did not have children to take care of, Iâ€™m not entirely certain she wouldnâ€™t have hurt herself by now. And still, sometimes she says things that make me think she plans to hurt herself as soon as weâ€™re grown and out of the house. 
It feels like sheâ€™s inconsolable. Nothing we say, nothing we do, ever makes her feel better. She always just has to calm down on her own, after yelling/crying for several hours. 
She demands apologies. When we give the apologies, she never believes theyâ€™re genuine. 
Is there anything we can say/do/try that might help? Has anyone ever dealt with a similar person?

mentalhealth,01/05/2019,sbeaumount,bjh3ou,3,1,"How to improve social anxiety? Hi. I have a long history of anxiety , especially social anxiety(maybe agoraphobia?) and really need help so I thought Iâ€™ll come on here for hopefully some advice. So this is my story. For as long as I can remember Iâ€™ve always been super anxious and really shy. I had a really hard time in school socializing, making friends, worrying all the time(anxiety) and I was also really depressed and super insecure (esp about my weight). Low key struggled with an eating disorder but was never official diagnosed. I remember in school I was known as that super shy weird girl who never talked. Literally kids would ask me all the time why I wouldnâ€™t talk and teachers always commented that I should speak up more. At some point I was even tested for a learning disability and had to go to speech therapy but all was fine except that I was a really sad, shy, and anxious kid. Anyway, things got really bad at 15. My social anxiety and depression became unbearable. I ended up accidentally dropping out of school despite not wanting to and being a straight A student. I just decide to stop going and my parents and I thought it was just going to be for a little while, while I got better however I ended up not going back to school for 1 1/2 years. During this time I was basically completely  home bound only going to target and the bookstore. I stopped talking to all my friends and only spoke to my parents and sister. I also gained a lot of weight which made my self esteem issues a lot worse. Anyway, after 1 1/2 year I kinda freaked out about school and decided to go do online school. I did this for a year and managed to catch up almost completely but sadly not on time to graduate with my class. This was a super depressing time for me. I slept all day and would cry a lot and had some really scary thoughts. I felt like a total loser. Anyways, I decided to go to summer school and then to an adult school to finally finish school. I managed to graduate hs at 19, one semester behind. However since graduating I have sadly become house bound again. Itâ€™s been a year and I donâ€™t know how to get help. I really want to make friends and live a normal life. Iâ€™m so sick of living like this. Sadly though I think that being at home all the time has made my social anxiety so much worse. I have to fly across the country in a month for my little sisters graduation and I am terrified. Iâ€™ll be in a completely different state, surround by people I donâ€™t know, who are expecting me to socialize. Iâ€™m seriously so scared. Iâ€™m working out and dieting like crazy because sadly I think that my weight might be a really big reason that Iâ€™m so scared and insecure about going out. I donâ€™t want to be judged. Iâ€™m also just so scared to have to be in such a different environment that i am used to.

Within the following next 3 months, after I met this girl, we talked about pretty much anything, music, art, gaming, stupid shit in general, It was great and I love it. We connected on so many things and had quite a lot of the same interests. More than any of my other friends I've ever had in my life and because of that... I fell for her, and I fell hard. At first, she also seemed to show interest until a month after we started to really get to know each other.

To understand why this next scenario happened, you have to realize she is someone who has depression and a very serious case at that. Someone who's going through stuff without any medication or therapy because she doesn't feel like she needs it because her problems aren't ""Therapist worthy"" even though she's absolutely miserable with her life, at least that I can see, so she vents a lot to her friends that she thinks can help her, leading to the serious scenario.

One of her friends she would vent to a lot tried to split with from her and that causes massive damage, causing her to change. Now by all means that it is perfectly acceptable to change after some massive damage to someone's mind like that, I wasn't sad that she did. I was happy until she stopped almost treating me like a friend now. As these feelings grew stronger on my side, they were weakening on hers and you could see it. Started with not talking about the one thing we first connected to, music. Then she stopped starting the conversations most of the time, stopped asking how I felt at all. Sometimes she would vent to me then tell me I'm making it worse which would destroy me. Then the venting slowly stopped happening for a while, the last part of my friend I had left was now gone and I was left with chats like ""You dum lol"" and we'd end chat there for 5 days. 

I brought things like this up a few times but she seemed to turn it towards her only or would brush it all off as a ""My mindset doesn't work like that"" type of deal and I'm not trying to make her out to be the bad guy, because that's not what I want, but that's just what I'm seeing from my point. This brought back the venting to a degree but now I feel like she does it out of pity and on top of that, she feels obligated to talk to me now. Every time I send a text to feels worse and worse and I hate it.

Now to throw salt into the wound, she's insanely jealous of my life. That I have IRL friends and a wholesome family while she doesn't have any of that. Her life around her is toxic, hence why she has very serious depression, which makes me believe she doesn't WANT me but more so needs me. While she was telling me this I felt awful knowing my existence brings her nothing but pain, yet I'm one of her only friends, which yet brings more pain onto my heart knowing that she would most likely not want me there if she had other friends to hang around with. I just can't comprehend why I fell so hard for someone who literally can't stand to be around me, I hate it so much. 

On top of that, I want to break away and move on but I don't know where I stand. Will I send her into a death spiral? Does she even care? Every time I try to bring this it's always the same answers that lead me to believe she wants me around, but her actions show otherwise and on top of that falling for someone who doesn't show any form on interest back leads me to feel clingy and obsessive. which is the one thing I don't want to be, especially towards her. She brings me the best happiness I ever experience and the worst sadness and anxiety I've had so far

Right now my world revolves around this one girl who I haven't even met IRL and It's crushing me. It shows all the signs of a one-way friendship because it seems she's in an ""Output only mode"" from the fallout. Don't get me wrong she has her moments around me where she laughs and has fun but I always feel like I'm bringing her pain or that I'm just ""there"" around her now. Dirt, air, nothing now and she knows how I feel too. I know she doesn't like me back but I can't understand how to move from this.

I want to let her know at least this small bit of how I'm feeling. But I've dumped too much on her as it is and I feel like I've ruined the friendship we once had and now I feel like she's talking out of pity. I just wish for once she'd ask how I was doing.... but it's clear that that won't happen.

mentalhealth,01/05/2019,RektMyAnus,bji0q9,9,1,"What do doctors do when anti-psychotics cause heart problems? I've lately developed noticable heart pauses. My physician says they could be due to psych meds, that is aripiprazole and tianeptine. I've already decided to taper off tianeptine as it never worked for me, but I'm curious about aripiprazole/anti-psychotics.

I've switched anti-psychotics before due to side-effects, but I can't imagine risking even greater heart-related side-effects by switching, so this seems a lot different to me. Would a doctor consider tapering off and never touching anti-psychotics again?

It's not just the heart-related side-effects either. I never wanted to be on an anti-psychotic in the first place, and I can say I would be much happier (although in some physical pain) without them. I also have other side-effects, most notably akathisia, which is an irresistible urge to move your legs and walk around.

How does tapering off anti-psychotics work?

I've actually attempted to taper off once, but it ended badly. I was mostly dizzy and kind of scared. Never had any symptoms I or my psychiatrist would call ""psychotic."" But I don't remember what exactly I experienced as it was so long ago. My diagnosis is *some other form* of schizophrenia (I don't know more about this), and I experience strong anxiety and depression. My psychiatrist said I had distorted thinking of some sort, but I'm not entirely sure what he meant by that.

mentalhealth,01/05/2019,AzuraBeth,bji2w2,2,14,"Just feeling shitty (long rant, you can skip if you want) So I have depression, anxiety and PTSD and the past month has been literal hell for me. I was triggered last month into remembering a trauma that I had buried for psychology reasons (I'm studying psychology and know the mental background for this happening but it's long winded). I've been having multiple flashbacks and panic attacks a day and so have stayed in my room for the majority of the time as I don't want to have a panic attack in public, even though that happened a few times. 

However, I've been trying to get myself out of that hole as my life now is actually pretty great and I want to enjoy it. I have two therapy sessions a week (sometimes more if needed) and am working with my doctor to find the right cocktail of medication to control the chemical imbalance in my head. I went out this weekend to treat myself and went shopping and saw endgame (btw if any of you like makeup, makeup obsession in the uk boots is phenomenal and cheap). I'm more stable now.

Despite this stability I still feel shitty. While I actually feel quite sick I'm just also going back and forth between feeling sad and feeling empty. The reason for this is because of my family. My sister is currently in a mental ward as she has severe psychosis and has come close to death twice this year. However, she's almost died so many times that, while it's really upsetting, it doesn't affect me like it should for others. My parents have always babied her and been kinder to her for as long as I can remember. While I'm an adult with my own life now, she's turning 18 this year and still is treated like a child by my parents. 

What's really upset me today is that I joked that my sister and I are both drop outs of school, even though we are now back in education. My parents response was to praise my sister for all her hard work and it felt like a slap in the face to me. This is a regular occurrence as well. I've developed from having such a severe depression that I didn't think I'd live past 18, to getting to an almost healthy mental state, to figuring out what I want to do with my life, to going to such a shit university that caused my PTSD from several traumatic instances, to going to my first choice university, to now where I'm consistently getting the highest grades despite having chronic pain and my mental illnesses. I barely get any words of recognition. The last time I told my parents my grade (75% which is high for uni), minutes later they were praising my sister over her winning a game of bowling. I just feel as though I can never win their love or attention because I'm the outcast in my family. I'm a bisexual pagan and my family are homophobic and strong Christians. I just want to be loved and acknowledged for my success as it's a really tough battle everyday and I'm winning.

I've never found a therapist I like to speak to when I'm upset. Only when I'm doing well. I quit my last therapist because she actually got argumentative with me. This guy has flimsy advice I often don't agree with and relies very heavily on empty supportive behavior like saying he's proud of me. I understand that might work for some people but it means nothing to me to hear that someone I barely know is proud of me, or that he knows I will be ok.

He also talks about himself for a bit too long and I noticed this past time he was on his phone a lot while I was talking and never acknowledged it. I figured maybe he was looking something up to show me but he never did, and he takes notes on his laptop so it wasn't that. He downplays everything which may be a good thing in some cases but when it comes to things like thinking my emotionally abusive, narcissistic dad ""just needs a hug,"" it doesn't help me. 

I told him I quit smoking and he assumed I meant cigarettes even though I had never brought up cigarettes ever and he's been wanting me to quit smoking weed, so thanks for solidifying that you don't remember anything about me or look at your notes, dude. Something else that really bothered me was when he tried to get me to punch the air to the Rocky soundtrack to motivate me and I was so embarrassed and kept saying no and he wouldn't let it go. 

But I'm tired of changing therapists this is my 4th, and there are no more to try at the local clinic I go to where my psychiatrist is.

We went out into the woods to a hut that's normally used for bird watching as it was a nice day and a great view. Everyone was drinking playing music and enjoying their selves. I can't actually remember anything but I apparently decided to go for a walk on my own after finishing my bottle and drinking half of someone's vodka.
I was found fitting in a Bush and I had hit my head pretty badly. An ambulance had been called and I was carried to the nearest road and taken to hospital.
I woke up 4 hours later after fitting many times.
I don't remember much of the hospital but I was sent home that night after I had my stomach pumped.

mentalhealth,01/05/2019,lanalikeslilac,bjk5hl,0,5,"You said you'd be there for me when I needed you..and the one time I needed you, you weren't there... The one person I could always rely on was...my mom. She loved me, and before she would always go to work she'd kiss my forehead and wave goodbye through the black screen door at my old daycare. I was about 5 or 6 at the time, so she left me at that daycare until my daycare babysitter would drop my off at elementary school. Mom said if I ever needed anything, to tell her...and... she'd listen. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day, I was waiting on the couch in the living room to go to school with my younger 4 year old friend lily... we were watching Dora, I remember it so vividly. Everything was normal..until...

&amp;#x200B;

I heard a voice from behind the couch. ***He*** was there. My daycare babysitter's son, let's call him.. Joe. He whispered out to me from behind the couch, ""hey, name, come back here for a second!"". I wasn't very introduced with joe, but all I knew was he was my babysitter's son, and he was an adult, so I had to listen to him. Being the good obedient 5 year old I was, I listened, and lily had gotten bored enough to have wandered into the separate playroom anyways. I went over to him, and he had...a camera with him. He whispered so he wouldn't draw any attention from anyone that was in the house already, ""I need something from you, okay? I need you to pretend to be a model for me...take off your pants."" I was confused, but agreed because I didn't know what was happening, and I didn't know I could say ""no"" to an adult at the time either, I thought it was a game. So I took them off, and he said,""Good, now lay down for me.."". I once again did as I was told, confused about everything. He held my legs above my head, spread them, and started taking pictures. I didn't know what was happening, I just listened. I whispered quietly as he pulled my pants up quickly, ""Was I a pretty model..?"" and that bastard smiled. He smiled, and he showed me those disgusting photos he took. He took a piece of my hair and started playing with it, whispering, ""You're so pretty, name, don't tell anyone what happened, okay? or else..."". I immediately was afraid. I didn't know why, but I was. He got up and quickly went into his room down the hall, and I just sat back on the couch watching Dora as if everything was fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year later, I was six or seven, and figured out what had happened on my own. I was still going to daycare, but on that day... I saw him. I was in the kitchen, and he came in. He smiled and I frowned. ""Remember out little secret?"" he asked, and I backed up a bit. ""Oh, I forgot, you showed me yours..I'll show you mine, okay?"" He showed me his disgusting privates and I backed up even more, I called for my mom and he left immediately.   


The next day, I wanted to tell her what had happened that year ago....

&amp;#x200B;

The one day i needed her to stay..I begged, ""mommy, I don't wanna be here, please, I wanna go with you..."" I begged her until I was sobbing, and she wondered what was wrong..but she didn't wonder for long.

&amp;#x200B;

She walked out the door.. kissed my forehead, waved goodbye through the black screen door.

&amp;#x200B;

and then when she came back i told her what happened..

&amp;#x200B;

And then that bitch...that mother of that son of a bitch....she said, ""now stop making up lies or i'll wash out your mouth with soap"" and i started....crying...

 

i tugged on your shirt, mom...i looked up at you with tears streaming down my face.......i said.. ""mommy i'm not lying, it really happened!""... i needed you to believe me i begged you to believe me....i thought you would....you said if i ever needed you and when i finally did you weren't there..

you brushed it off your shoulder like it was nothing...

I have been trying to go to more events to be more active within my schoolâ€™s community. For example, I went to a huge psychology conference with people from my psychology club. I wanted to back out in the last minute. I was anxiously thinking about what I would say in conversations and whether or not people would judge me. However, I forced myself to go and it wasnâ€™t as bad as I had thought it would be. Iâ€™m glad I went. 

I recently applied to be a psyc club member a few weeks ago. Today I got an email saying I was one of the new members! This may not seem like a big deal, but this will be my FIRST college board member position. I did not have a club position since high school( which was years ago). Anyways, itâ€™s going to be a challenge since I am naturally quiet. But Iâ€™m really excited for this opportunity.

Attending the second to last year of high school,  struggling to find a reason to even get out of bed. Sometimes I skip school for three days in a week because I'm so tired.

I just don't see a reason to stay at school anymore, yet I still tried my best to go to school when i'm not trying to cut my head off.

Recently the head teacher of my school's disciplinary team came for me during class and asked to talk to me. He then proceeded to have this talk about how I should not be depressed when the counselling teachers are helping me so much, how I am wasting the school's quotas by not attending school, how I'm enjoying all this attention that the teachers gave me, and how ""can't get out of bed so I skipped school"" is an absolute excuse.. needless to say I was devastated. Cried for an entire week. In class, in shower, in the middle of a bad dream, in the middle of a league of legends game.. anywhere.

mentalhealth,01/05/2019,PrincesseDia,bjl6m1,0,1,"Can I just vent about my mom real quick So, my biological mom is schizoeffictive-bipolar. She was diagnosed pretty young and shes currently 56. I'm 24 and so far I haven't been diagnosed with a bipolar disorder or any form of schizophrenia so I'm hoping I'm in the clear. I do have the standard depression and anxiety , though, that's fairly severe. 
I love my mom very much and our relationship has been tested and strained over the years but since I made it to adulthood I've made an effort to be as supportive of her as possible. She should have never had kids, so I feel a tremendous guilt for existing and essentially ruining her life. When she has episodes I try and stay as neutral as possible and deal with the abuse to make sure shes safe, and visit her in the hospital every day even if she doesnt want me to. 
Even when shes ""healthy"", though, things are hard. She lives on the other side of the city from me in an assisted living community. I live with my brother and grandparents (her parents). I try to see her atleast twice a week and drive her to get groceries and to docs appointments and to take her for dinner or coffee and sometimes she comes to our place and stays for a day or two. 
The issue is shes super impulsive, which is part of her illness. And very entitled and demanding. If she wants to visit, she calls and expects us to drop everything and go pick her up or run errands for her. It's frustrating because we almost never say no but sometimes we cant go right away and say we can make it in a few hours or so. She'll say okay and then contact my brother, and then my grandpa respectively until she gets what she wants. Theres no compromising. 

Like this past week, there was a problem with my paycheck and I got paid a week late. She called me on my regular pay day and asked if she could borrow money. I told her I was sorry but I hadn't got paid and I literally have no money. I told her she could come over if she didnt have any food, but she just called me an ungrateful liar and hung up on me. The standard is I'm just supposed to pretend it didnt happen and move on the following day, which I did. Yesterday she came to stay at our place for the night. She said she needed to go grocery shopping so the plan was we would go early this morning, as my brother had to go too, and then take her home after. At 730 we got up and she was already gone. She asked my grandpa to drive her home earlier than that, apparently. She later called and asked when I was coming over to take her to the store, and to bring her some stuff she left here. I asked her why she couldnt have just come with us this morning and she just said ""I didnt realize I was such a bother"" and then hung up on me again. Then she called my brother and asked him to take her instead. 

It's really tough. I dont know how to set boundaries with her, shes like a small child. I honestly dont think shes emotionally matured passed a young adolescent. Believe it or not I've made lots of progress setting boundaries in adulthood. This kind of thing frustrates me so much but I dont know if shes actually capable of behaving any other way. I know sometimes she gets spikes of anxiety and that can contribute to her impulsiveness so i try to be as accommodating as possible. When we try to set firmer boundaries she throws a huge fit and has tried to kill herself. This past Christmas she got angry that my brother and I got gifts for my foster family that we still keep in touch with, and she wouldnt talk to any of us other than the nasty messages she would leave on our phones. I was still compelled to go check on her though and try and make up, and get her to spend Christmas with us. We ended up phoning the police to do a wellness check on her and she had overdosed on some sleeping pills so we spent Christmas eve in the emergency with her.

I cant even explain the anxiety I feel when I have to talk to her when shes angry or tell her no, and the guilt I feel for feeling frustrated with her. I'm just so tired and I can barely get out of bed to take care of myself and I have to try and take care of her as well and I'm just failing miserably. 

Thanks so much if you took the time to read this. My family and friends dont understand why I dont just cut off contact with her, but she'd end up homeless or dead if I did that.

mentalhealth,01/05/2019,britneyspearsstan123,bjlhe2,2,1,"Depression: Facts and Advice I learnt in psychology class that a bad self esteem is created by having unrealistic expectations. We have three versions of ourselves: who we think we are, who others think we are and who we want to be. Sometimes, who we want to be is too far from who we actually are - so we must make it a little more realistic and achieve that first before moving onto bigger steps. 
Nobody talks about the hygiene aspect of depression. One symptom of depression is not having the motivation to take care of your personal hygiene. But, taking care of yourself will become easier if you make it a habit and it can also make you feel very refreshed and better than before. 
Depression does NOT last forever, but it does if you let it. Please try to get out of bed, leave your house, pursue a hobby. You have a lot of potential that you are throwing away and you must realise that sometimes your brain is working against you. Do not give up without a fight.

happy,02/05/2019,OcularAMVs,bjqc0y,1,5,"After many months of change, uncertainty, embarrassment, and fear, I finally got an opportunity to feel confident about the future  

This has been a crazy year. Just 8 months ago, I was in an accelerated medical program with a lot of people having expectations on me and friends who were far ahead than I could ever hope to reach. My entire summer was spent in my white coat in lectures 8-5pm everyday and the rest of the time was either spent in the hospital, studying, or sleeping for a few hours.

On the last day of the summer semester, I made the biggest decision of my life. I left the program. My biggest fear was the all my friends in the program would drift away from me and that I would have to spend the remaining 2 years of my undergrad feeling jealous and unfulfilled compared to all those around me.

Luckily I have great friends who have only supported me. Parents who accepted my decision and supported me as well. And I had a great group of people in the business department I switched into who put good words in for me to get a good internship which opened a lot of doors.

Still I felt so behind and seeing all my peers get internships in incredible places like NASA and Goldman Sachs made me feel like I really lost a great opportunity from leaving the medical program. I kept getting rejected from all these internships and students usually find out in February/March if they got accepted.

It was all quiet on my side. I panicked, thinking about what I was going to do for the summer. Felt unmotivated, worthless, and just embarrassed. But after 100+ applications, many interviews, and even more rejections, a great company emailed me last week saying they want to interview me.

I prepared as much as I could, knowing that this was my final chance to seal something for the summer. I got through the 2 rounds and today I got a call with the HR lady saying I got the internship!!! I couldn't more grateful for the people who have supported me and I am just so glad things worked out last minute.

TL;DR: Been through a lot of changes, doubting myself and my decision. Got rejected from numerous internships and got an offer very last minute.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

My dad has always been very supportive of me being childfree and has always encouraged me to live my life on my terms. He came to visit me the other day and during one of our conversations , he jokingly said ""I knew since you were a little girl that kids weren't for you"". I asked him what he meant and he told me this story from when I was 4 years old.

My dad's friend had gifted me one of those baby dolls that cried, giggled etc. At first I seemed to like it. But then one day the damn thing just wouldn't stop crying and after 2 minutes of listening to it wail, I got pissed. I threw it on the floor and stomped on it a few times, while telling it to shut up. It still wouldn't shut up. So I picked it up and ripped it's fucking head off. The crying stopped.

This happened during a family gathering almost the entire extended family was there. My aunt, uncles and cousins looked on, in sheer horror, as I mutilated my ""baby"". My dad just laughed because he thought it was hilarious.

happy,02/05/2019,MeepM00PDude,bjvaqe,0,5,"Today kicks off a bunch of life changes including a big move, into my dream house, with my dream partner. After a few really crappy years, I'm finally happy. I hope my title was straightforward enough while still giving a bit of mystery for the read. I don't ever visit the sub, because what this sub represents used to be so far outside of my emotional range I never identified with it. That all started changing about a month ago.

Long story short and to save some details, my girlfriend's job is moving us back to the state she's from. Her job moved us here in the first place and we never really liked it, honestly it never felt like home in the 3+ years we've been here. On top of that, she and I both lost immediate family members within 4 months of each other, and a bunch of other really not good shit happened. I shared with you all of the terrible to lend context to just how over the moon the sudden change of fortune has made me. 

In two weeks when we move back in my partner's home state, we are moving into a home that we happened to stumble upon right at the start of our move planning phase. It's incredible in so many ways, twice the size of our current place, with reasonable rent, a landlord who's amazing, gigabit internet, Ethernet LAN in every room, and due to timing we were the only people who saw it. This house would have vanished off the market had our landlord been available to show it right away when they put it up. We got so lucky with the house, and that was literally the beginning. Well not the complete beginning because how my girlfriend got her relocation/job was insanely lucky also but that's a story for another day.

Because of this move, and the new job, and a couple of smart financial decisions, we're set up in a way where on top of moving into the dream home I get to cross the largest item off of my bucket list. We decided to put a home arcade in the house because we have the space, and I've dreamed of having a home arcade since I was a small child. What's crazy is I thought it would be a difficult ask of my partner, but she's just as excited as I am and it's blowing my mind. We found our white whale machines by pure luck also. Absolutely insane serendipity. Same goes for the artwork, sound system, lighting, everything we found for relatively cheaper than retail through entirely honest but entirely lucky means. The amount of serendipity I've experienced in last month is still just mind numbing.

Add in the fact I can finally go back to medicating and not feeling like a criminal doing so, the new photography locations the city brings, with a bunch more stuff to do culturally and culinarily. All of those things alone have absolutely blown my mind with joy. I was talking to my partner a few nights ago and I was telling her how I had something similar to my panic attacks only out of joy, I was so overwhelmed with positive happy emotion that I didn't know what to do and I just kind of shut down. It was really weird but really really really neat especially since it's such a departure from how I've been the last few years.

What's crazy though is it doesn't stop there, the reason that I'm absolutely blown away is because of the family that is excited to welcome me back. When I was there last, I had just started dating my girlfriend. Her family and I while cordial never really felt like we bonded, but over the course of the last 5 years we have bonded in small weekend visits or online interaction. My family dissolved a while ago, and so to know that there is a large family group waiting and excited to have me (us) back feels really good. Really really really really good, I've missed this and I didn't realize how much I needed it.

Thank you all for letting me brag about my joy and toys and new life. It really has been a rough few years, I lost my brother to suicide a little over 2 years ago and for the first time since then I don't feel guilty for surviving. For the first time in 2 years truly I know he would be jealous and happy for me and my joy.

I got married a year and a half ago. I love my wife very much and she makes me happy, but relationships take a lot of work; especially for me, being an introvert with a little social anxiety. I struggle to communicate when I know I should be talking more, I miss important cues sometimes, and I can get inexplicably upset over stupid things. I know all of this but itâ€™s hard to change them.

I was very nervous going into this. I wasnâ€™t sure if I would be able to come out of my shell to be vocally supportive during labor, and I wasnâ€™t sure how I would act with my son once he was born. I knew Iâ€™d love him but thatâ€™s an academic thought more than anything.

The day that we went in to induce her, I was running on little sleep which made things worse and I expected it to go badly. But as soon as things got going I snapped into it and honestly I think I did a great job. When it mattered the most I did what needed to be done without thinking about how I wouldnâ€™t normally act that way.

Then, 24 hours later, my son was born and I swear it felt like there was nothing in the room except for my wife and my son. He came out wide-eyed, looking around, and very calm. He was the most perfect little baby Iâ€™ve ever seen (and Iâ€™ve seen a lot).

I feel like a completely different person. Iâ€™m smiling so much more. Iâ€™m being more vocally loving with my wife (like I should have before). Iâ€™ve been singing to him and talking to him nonstop, things that I ordinarily would feel embarrassed about. Iâ€™m self-conscious about that sort of thing even in front of my wife and my relatives but with him it just doesnâ€™t even occur to me. Iâ€™m holding him right now while he sleeps and heâ€™s just the most precious little angel.

I am 28 years old and have never really been in a relationship where I felt like I loved the one I was seeing. As of October of last year I had been single for 3 1/2 years. Happily. Well, last year I spent 4 months in the Philippines for work, alone, and it really changed my mindset. It made me realize that having someone to come home to or share your life with is important and really necessary for your sanity. Humans arenâ€™t meant to be alone. So on that note, in November when I returned home, I started dating and met a girl, in January we split. I knew I didnâ€™t love her, and I donâ€™t play games - when she said she was done... it was done. 

Now right around the same time I returned home I also started working with a new group of people and she happened. In walks this girl who blew my mind. Instantly. Her looks, her attitude, personality and interests.. everything about her - but I already am seeing someone and I am trying to find that human connection I knew I was missing. So I disregarded, I knew I didnâ€™t love her and tried to make it work... 

It didnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve never cheated. I wouldnâ€™t.. I know how it hurts. I am an honest and blunt man. But the moment she said she was done my mind went back to her. The girl who walked in and stole my attention. The one who was everything Iâ€™d been looking for all this time. I reached out, nonchalantly, tried to be cool.. she agreed to a date. And another. 

Here we are, two months in. Present day. I am in fucking love with her. I canâ€™t stand a second without her and I want to be everything she needs and more. 

I told her today that I loved her. I told her I didnâ€™t want to scare her away and that it seems foolish of me for only seeing her for such a short amount of time but I couldnâ€™t wait anymore... She told me she loved me too.
